        "## EEG Feature Extraction and Classification Using FB-CCA\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook focuses on EEG feature extraction and classification using Filter Bank Canonical Correlation Analysis (FB-CCA), a method particularly effective in SSVEP BCIs.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Use Temporal Features (like CCA) Instead of Spectral Features?\n",
        "While traditional spectral methods (e.g., power spectral density) analyze EEG frequency components independently, temporal feature extraction methods like Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) leverage correlations between EEG signals and predefined reference signals across multiple channels. This approach effectively captures spatial and temporal coherence patterns inherent in EEG data, providing robustness against noise and improving discriminative performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is FB-CCA and Why Might it Work?\n",
        "Filter Bank CCA (FB-CCA) enhances the standard CCA by decomposing EEG data into multiple sub-band frequency components (filter banks). Each frequency band undergoes separate CCA processing, and their outputs are combined, typically through weighted averaging. This multiband approach exploits frequency-specific information more comprehensively, significantly improving classification accuracy, especially in noisy environments or with individual subject variations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Dataset and Experimental Setup\n",
        "The dataset utilized here currently includes EEG recordings from 11 subjects SSVEP stimulation. Each subject's EEG data is segmented into epochs corresponding to specific stimulus frequencies, allowing evaluation of the FB-CCA method's effectiveness in classifying these frequencies. The experimental details, including stimulus conditions and EEG recording protocols, are described in a separate documentation file.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook specifically demonstrates the preprocessing, FB-CCA feature extraction, and classification workflows, emphasizing the temporal coherence captured by FB-CCA.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Classification Methods Compared\n",
        "Initially, we will classify EEG trials simply by selecting the stimulus frequency that yields the highest CCA correlation coefficient per trial. This baseline approach will be compared with training a simple classifier (KNN) on extracted CCA features. Although KNN might not be the most efficient classifier, it is chosen here due to its simplicity and minimal hyperparameter tuning requirements, allowing to focus on feature extraction method instead. Finally, the performance of these methods will be compared against the enhanced FB-CCA approach."

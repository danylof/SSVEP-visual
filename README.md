# SSVEP-Visual: EEG Analysis and Classification

This project focuses on the analysis and classification of EEG data from SSVEP tasks. The main objectives are visual assessment, preprocessing optimization, and feature selection to enhance classification accuracy in BCI applications.

### Current Project Components:

- **Visual Assessment of EEG Data:**  
  Evaluation of spectral responses to identify optimal filtering parameters (e.g., cutoff frequencies) for preprocessing EEG signals.

- **Feature Extraction and Selection:**  
  Implementation and comparison of various feature extraction techniques, notably Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Filter Bank CCA (FB-CCA), to improve stimulus classification accuracy.
